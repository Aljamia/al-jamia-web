              The Periodicals Reading Room in the library provides a space for
              reading various journals and newspapers in different languages.
              The library operates from 6.30 am to 10.15 pm and serves hundreds
              of people daily. Searching, issuing, and returning books have been
              made easy using the book magic software. One of the notable
              features of the librarys procedures is its adherence to the D.D.C
              Classification system. In addition to book discussions, the
              Library Hall is equipped with a large LED smart TV, providing
              access to channel programs in different languages, including

              published in various languages and has adopted the Open Access
              system for readers convenience. To maintain order, books taken
              from the shelf are placed on the table after reading, and the
              library staff organizes them on the shelf at the end.
