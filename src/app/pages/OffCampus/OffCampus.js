                      Al Jamia Mewat Campus, affiliated with Al Jamia Al Islamia
                      in South India, combines Kerala 's creative educational
                      model with North India's fertile land. The institution's
                      mission is to prepare scholars, educational experts, and
                      leaders who can guide their communities and humanity using
                      true Islamic sources. They focus on holistic student
                      development, offering a two-year program for 11th and 12th
                      graders, hostel facilities for both genders, and a
                      curriculum that combines modern and traditional Islamic
                      education. Punctuality, character building, and 24-hour
                      schedules are priorities. The campus emphasizes training
                      alongside education, emphasizing intellect, character, and
                      personal development. Al Jamia Mewat Campus provides a
                      peaceful, non-urban location, offers approved courses in
                      subjects like Political Science, History, and Arabic,
                      promotes extracurricular studies with teacher-supervised
                      library hours, encourages reading newspapers and
                      magazines, and systematically develops speaking and
                      creative abilities. Proximity to New Delhi allows students
                      to benefit from scholars and experts. The campus hosts
                      literary and cultural activities, sports, and personality
                      development workshops, emphasizing positive changes in
                      moral and spiritual terms. It provides separate facilities
                      for male and female students and emphasizes intellectual
                      awareness to tackle modern challenges within an
                      IslamicÂ context.
